# Data-Analysis-Final-Project-
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a comprehensive analysis of global population dynamics, demographic patterns, and land insights using data from 2024.


By analyzing these factors across different
countries, the analysis seeks to identify significant trends and
correlations that can inform decision-making, policy development,
and strategic planning at both national and global levels. The
analysis also aims to provide insights into how different regions
contribute to global demographics and land usage, helping to
highlight areas of potential growth, challenges, and opportunities
for sustainable development.


Analysis Methodology
i. Data Collection
To ensure the highest quality data, an extensive search was
conducted across various websites and data banks to find the
most reliable sources. The primary objective of this research was
to analyze global population data and derive meaningful insights.
Key parameters such as population, country, and other relevant
metrics were chosen to cover three main topics: Population
Dynamics, Demographics, and Land Insights.
The actual data collection process was executed using Python
scripts that performed web scraping across multiple websites.
The scraped data was then stored in CSV files as data frames,
ready for the next steps of cleaning and preprocessing.
ii. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The data cleaning and preprocessing were carried out using a
combination of Python scripts and Excel. The process involved
removing null values, eliminating duplicates, correcting data
types, and filling in missing values using methods like mean,
median, and mode. Additionally, column names were standardized
across all datasets to ensure consistency.
iii. Tools Used
MySQL and MySQL Workbench were employed as the database
repository for storing and querying the data. The cleaned and
preprocessed data were then utilized in Power BI, Tableau, and
Excel to generate insights, measures, and visually appealing
dashboards.
